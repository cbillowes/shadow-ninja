# @shadow-ninja/components

This is a react app with webpack and babel configured to export components specifically used by shadow-ninja.

I followed this guide to create a brand new package by following
[this](https://dev.to/deadwing7x/setup-a-react-app-with-webpack-and-babel-4o3k) tutorial.

## Prerequisites

* Node `v12.14.1` or higher
* Yarn `v1.22.10` or higher

## Get started

* `yarn run dev` to create a dev server which serves the index.html page which should contain all the components defined in the App.js file.
* `debug` and `release` are used to generate the JavaScript files and minify for production (on release).
